- ### Connect [[PowerShell]] [[Microsoft Graph]] SDK v2 using environment variables #authentication #scripting
	- Environment variables store the parameter keys and values, which then serve as input to your script and can help to not leaky information when sharing them with others. Now use **-EnvironmentVariable** to **Connect-MgGraph** to support environment variable based auth. It is important to notice that an error will be thrown if username and password are used to authenticate as this is not supported by design and that client secret takes precedence over certificate, i.e., if values for a client secret and certificate are both present, the client secret will be used. See [Azure.Identity Environment Variables](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/identity/Azure.Identity#environment-variables) for more details.
		- ```powershell
		  # Add environment variables to be used by Connect-MgGraph.
		  $Env:AZURE_CLIENT_ID = "application id of the client app"
		  $Env:AZURE_TENANT_ID = "Id of your tenant"
		  $Env:AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET = "secret of the client app"
		  # Tell Connect-MgGraph to use your environment variables.
		  Connect-MgGraph –EnvironmentVariable
		  ```
